Hello Salmon!

In order to launch the tests, you need to clone the repo and execute `./gradlew test` as usual.

>[!NOTE]
>The project was written with the use of **Java 21** and the latest version of Kotlin for the moment, so some updates may be necessary.

>[!TIP]
You can skip this part and see test results in Actions tab. I've created this workflow to be manually triggerable, but it is mandatory to add you into collaborators if you want to launch the workflow yourself.
If it's OK to you, share your login with me and I'll add it into the team. You then will have to wait for the invitation (it will appear in GH notifications and in your mailbox I believe) and accept it, usually takes around 30 seconds. 
Afterwards, you will get the possibility to press the big red button :D

But of course, you can always do it the old-fashioned way.

Test report will be available with `./gradlew allureServe`
